This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for minimally invasive procedures and advancements in healthcare technology, which are driving the adoption of liquid embolic agents in various medical treatments. The market is fueled by the rising prevalence of neurological diseases, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and cerebral aneurysms, where liquid embolic agents are widely used in embolization procedures. Additionally, the growing preference for non-invasive treatments is expected to further propel the market over the forecast period, as these agents provide effective and precise occlusion of blood vessels, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing recovery times.</p><h2>Liquid Embolic Agent Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>Liquid embolic agents are widely used in various applications, including the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders, gastrointestinal bleeding, and oncology. In cerebrovascular applications, these agents are crucial for the embolization of arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, and other vascular abnormalities in the brain. The precise and controlled embolization offered by liquid agents helps in achieving better clinical outcomes while minimizing risks to adjacent healthy tissues. Additionally, in gastrointestinal applications, liquid embolic agents are increasingly used to control bleeding, particularly in cases of variceal or tumor-related hemorrhage. Their ability to effectively occlude blood vessels in a targeted manner is beneficial for reducing the risk of rebleeding. With these versatile applications, liquid embolic agents are becoming essential tools in a variety of medical procedures, leading to their rising popularity in clinical practice.</p><h2>Liquid Embolic Agent Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>Oncology is another significant application area where liquid embolic agents play an important role. These agents are used in the embolization of tumors, particularly in liver cancer and other hypervascular tumors. Liquid embolization helps to block the blood supply to tumors, thereby inducing necrosis and reducing tumor size. The growing incidence of cancer and the increasing preference for minimally invasive procedures in oncological treatments are expected to drive the demand for liquid embolic agents in this sector. Moreover, the ability of these agents to deliver a high level of precision makes them an attractive option for tumor embolization, improving both safety and efficacy compared to traditional surgical approaches. As the field of interventional oncology continues to expand, liquid embolic agents are likely to play an even larger role in the management of various cancer types, contributing to the overall growth of the market.</p></h3><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Liquid Embolic Agent Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medtronic</Li><Li> Terumo</Li><Li> Balt</Li><Li> MicroVention</Li><Li> CERENOVUS</Li><Li> Meril Life</Li><Li> Saikesaisi Holding</h3><h3 id="ember53" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">Global&nbsp;Liquid Embolic Agent Market Segmentation:</h3><p id="ember54" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Segmentation analysis involves dividing the market into distinct groups based on certain criteria, such as type and application.
