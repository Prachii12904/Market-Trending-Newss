This segment continues to expand as banks enhance their ATM networks to improve customer accessibility and operational efficiency. Additionally, the retail segment is seeing increased adoption of ATMs, particularly in locations such as shopping malls and convenience stores. Retail ATMs provide consumers with easy access to cash while they shop, offering a seamless integration into their shopping experience. The growth in this application area is driven by the rising demand for cash accessibility in high-traffic retail environments.</p><p>Another significant application segment is the corporate sector, where ATMs are used to facilitate cash management for businesses.
